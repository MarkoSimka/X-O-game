##  Firebase Services

###  Real-time Database
The game uses Firebase's real-time database to store and synchronize game state between players. Firebase's onSnapshot method is used to listen for changes in the database and update the UI in real-time.

###  Authentication
Firebase Authentication is used to authenticate players and manage player sessions. Players can sign up, log in, and log out using various authentication providers supported by Firebase.
